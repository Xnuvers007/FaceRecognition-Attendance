### Face Detection Algorithm

The system uses MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks), a state-of-the-art face detection algorithm that works in three stages:

1. **Proposal Network (P-Net)**: A shallow CNN that generates candidate facial regions
2. **Refine Network (R-Net)**: Filters the candidates from P-Net
3. **Output Network (O-Net)**: Produces the final bounding box and facial landmarks

This approach allows for highly accurate face detection even with various poses, lighting conditions, and occlusions. The system also adds dynamic margins around detected faces to ensure the entire face is captured for recognition.

### Face Recognition Architecture

The recognition system employs a dual-pathway approach for maximum accuracy:

1. **Feature Extraction**: 
   - Uses MobileNetV2 (pre-trained on ImageNet) as the base model
   - The base model is fine-tuned on the captured face dataset
   - GlobalAveragePooling2D reduces spatial dimensions while preserving feature information
   - Dense layers create a 256-dimensional face embedding vector

2. **Classification**:
   - Additional dense layers for final classification
   - Softmax activation for class probability distribution
   - Trained with categorical cross-entropy loss

### Unknown Face Detection

The system implements a sophisticated method to identify unknown individuals:

1. **Embedding Generation**: Computes a 256-dimensional embedding vector for each face
2. **Reference Database**: Maintains average embeddings for all known individuals
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Uses cosine similarity to measure distance between embeddings
4. **Threshold Classification**: Employs dynamic thresholding to determine if a face is known
5. **Confidence Fusion**: Combines classifier confidence with embedding similarity for robust decision-making

## 🧩 System Components

The system consists of four main modules:

1. **Data Collection Module**:
   - Captures high-quality facial images with diverse poses
   - Applies automatic face detection and cropping
   - Creates a structured dataset organized by individual

2. **Training Module**:
   - Preprocesses and augments face images
   - Trains the embedding and classification networks
   - Implements early stopping and learning rate reduction
   - Fine-tunes the model for optimal performance
   - Generates and stores reference embeddings

3. **Recognition Module**:
   - Processes live video feed in real-time
   - Detects and recognizes faces with confidence scores
   - Implements duplicate detection for attendance tracking
   - Provides visual feedback with bounding boxes and labels

4. **Reporting Module**:
   - Logs attendance with timestamps
   - Maintains daily and master attendance records
   - Provides attendance summaries and analytics
   - Supports detailed historical data viewing

- Attendance logs contain only names and timestamps, not biometric data
- The system can be configured to require minimum confidence thresholds
- User consent is required for data collection and processing
- Compliance with local data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)
- Regular audits and updates to ensure data security
- Option to anonymize data for research purposes
- Clear user guidelines for data handling and privacy policies
- User authentication for accessing sensitive data
- Option to delete user data upon request
- Regular security updates and patches for software dependencies
